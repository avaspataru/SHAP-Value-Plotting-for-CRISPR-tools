
"""
A script which modifies the scoring methods to standardize the feature names.

CHOP-CHOP counts the positions in the guide from the PAM towards the start of
the guide (20 - 1) and the positions after the PAM in increasing order.

All the other tools analysed in this project count the guide positions in
increasing order. Therefore, to standardize, this script changes the scoring
method dictionaries from below to count the guide positions increasingly.
